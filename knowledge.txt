Photosynthesis is a vital process for life on Earth. It is the process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy, through a process that uses sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

The primary inputs, or reactants, for photosynthesis are light energy, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Chlorophyll, a pigment found in chloroplasts, plays a crucial role in absorbing light energy.

The main outputs, or products, of photosynthesis are glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). Glucose is a sugar molecule that provides energy and building material for the plant. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere, which is essential for aerobic respiration in animals and many other organisms. The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2.
